Place full /certificate directory in /mod directory, log like admin go to notifications and wait auto install to make changes on database.

If you have previous certificate installed be sure that database was actualized, this version requires some database
alterations, in my tests this happen with some delay in systems with older certificates installed, but happen. ;)
 
Certificate 4.X is not compatible with older certificate types. I recommend deleting all types and installing only
type that follow the package.

Certificate 4.X was tested w/ moodle 1.7+ AND moodle 1.8 running over PHP5 environment.

Certify if “locale” of your system is appropriate for your Moodle language pack.
