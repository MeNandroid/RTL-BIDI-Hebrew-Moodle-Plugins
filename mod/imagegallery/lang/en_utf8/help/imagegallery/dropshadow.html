<h3>Drop shadow</h3>
<p>Use drop shadow effect when creating thumbnail images.
This setting does not affect already made thumbnails.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE!!!</strong> You'll need PHP version 5 or greater to make drop shadow to look great.
PHP version 4 does not have imagefilter-function which makes the blur effect.</p>
