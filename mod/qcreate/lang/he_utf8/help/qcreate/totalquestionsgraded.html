<h1>Total Questions Graded</h1>

<p>This is the total number of questions that students must create.</p>
<p>This number must be equal to or greater than the minimum number of questions required. For example, if you want to  specify that students create 2 Matching type questions and 2 Multiple Choice type questions, you will have to select 4 or higher in  the Total Questions Graded menu. If you select a number higher than 4, then students will be able to create other questions in excess of the two Matching and two Multiple Choice types. The type of the extra questions created will depend on the types allowed in "Graded Question Types".</p>
