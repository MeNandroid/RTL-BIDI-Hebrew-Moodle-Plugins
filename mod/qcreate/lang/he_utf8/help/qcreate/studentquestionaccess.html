<h1>Student question access</h1>

<p>Use this menu to define what access rights students have over the questions they create. There are four types:</p>

<p>1) create only: this is the strictest; once a student clicks on the [Save question] button, they will not be able to edit the question again.

<p>2) preview: ???</p>

<p>3) preview and view / save as new: students can do just about everyhing, except edit already created creations. This also means that they can't delete questions they have already made.</p>

<p>4) preview, view / save as new and edit / delete: this is the higest level access that students can have. For an activity in which you want students to go through an ioterative process of question creation, evaluation, and improvemnt,  this is proabably the best setting.</p>
