<h1>Writing Criteria</h1>
<p><em>Well written criteria are the key to a successful peer review assignment.</em></p>
<h2>Criteria should be...</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong><br />
Criteria should be <strong>objective</strong> rather than subjective. They should be used to test the presence or correctness of a feature. They should not be used to ask students to make a judgement of quality. Students (even Masters students) cannot be consistent when asked to make subjective judgments.</li>
<li><strong>Concise</strong><br />
Students should be able to evaluate the work of another student, even if they themselves have not reached that standard. This means you should provide instructions on how to test the criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Binary</strong><br />
If at first thought a scale is desired, how would you define the levels of that scale - what differentiates the levels? Then ask: what level is desirable? Setting a binary criterion at the desired level drives students to accomplish that level. If you want to offer reward for a partially correct response, or a superior response, divide that criterion into finer grained criteria that are more specific. Using this sort of rubric can encourage greater retention and better student outcomes. Students appreciate removing the "guess-work"; this makes assignment work "achievable".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hidden Answers</h2>
<p>The criteria are shown to students with the assignment description, even before they submit.</p>
<p>An optional alternate text can be provided for each criterion. This second text will appear only during and after reviewing. This allows you to create criteria with specific answers or tests that are not shown to the students before they submit.</p>
<h2>More Complex Criteria Text</h2>
<p>Criteria can be simple short pieces of text, or more complex. If you know a bit of HTML, then this can help you create criteria with structure and formatting. For example, tags such as <code>&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;</code> can be placed around text to make it <strong>strong</strong>, <code>&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;</code> for <em>emphasis</em>, a singleton <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tag can be used to include a line break, and so on.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following are good examples are objective, concise binary criteria.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2" style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc;"><em>Example from a programming assignment...</em></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /></td>
		<td><strong>Comments are used to describe the purpose of blocks of code</strong><br />There should be at least three comments. Comments should describe blocks of code with a common purpose, eg., <pre>// Outputting a list with user stats</pre></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2" style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc;"><em>Example from a word processing assignment...</em></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /></td>
		<td><strong>An automatic table of contents is used</strong><br />The table of contents should have been created automatically, based on heading style headings, rather than entered manually. If you click in the table of contents, the entire table should be selected. You should not be able to edit the table of contents manually.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2" style="border-top:1px solid #cccccc;"><em>Example from an essay assignment...</em></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align:top;"><input type="checkbox" checked disabled /></td>
		<td><strong>Citations follow the IEEE referencing style</strong><br />Citations should be formatted in the IEEE style with a number in square brackets, for example <em>"...conclusively demonstrated [4]."</em>. Where a quote is presented, the page number should also be shown.</td>
