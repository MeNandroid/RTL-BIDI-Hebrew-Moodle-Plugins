<h1>Setting All Unset Calculatable Grades</h1>

<p>Clicking this button will cause all submissions with a suggested grade, but no final grade, to have their suggested grade applied as a final grade.
In other words, for all submissions, if a suggested grade is available, and a grade has not be applied as a final grade, the suggested grade will be set as the final grade.</p>

<p>With this button, moderation and release-of-grades can be achieved in two phases. Moderations can be applied to resolve any conflicts between reviews. Once all conflicts are resolved, this button can be used to release all grades.</p>

<p>If late submissions arrive, this button can be used to set grades for late arriving submissions, without affecting earlier submissions with final grades already set.</p>
