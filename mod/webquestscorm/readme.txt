Installation Manual

The WebQuest-SCORM module installation is done like any other module in Moodle. Taking into account that a tree structure for language and help files has been followed, the module installation is easier and needs only two steps. We will refer to [htdocsmoodle] as the directory where Moodle web pages are stored.

C.1     webquestscorm folder:
		#Copy the webquestscorm folder in --> [htdocsmoodle] \mod

C.2	Install WebQuest-SCORM module:
		#Use the Notifications link using dministrator credentials
C.3 	Just in case of making the installation in Moodle 1.7.* or previous versions, copy the file mod.html placed in /previousversions in the webquestscorm directory
