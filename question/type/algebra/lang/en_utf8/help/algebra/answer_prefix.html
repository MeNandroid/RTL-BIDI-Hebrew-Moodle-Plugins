<h1>Answer Box Prefix</h1>

<p>The text entered here will be placed in front of the input box where
students enter their answers. For example if a question is asking the form
of a function, f(x), then the string "f(x) = " could be entered in this
field.</p>

<p>Note that by default the string is not passed through the LaTeX filter.
If this is desired then simply surround the string with two double-dollar 
signs as per the normal LaTeX filter syntax. For example if you ask for
the derivative of a function f(x) you may want to enter 
'$$\frac{df}{dx}$$ = ' here.</p>
