<h1>Check Tolerance</h1>

<p>This parameter determines the maximum difference between numerical
evaluations of the student response and question answers which will be
allowed to count as matching. When the two expressions are evaluated
and found to differ by more than the amount specified here then they
will be regarded as different expressions. The value is treated as
a fractional difference.</p>

<p>For example, if the student response evaluates to be 10.3 and the
question answer evaluates to be 10.2 then the tolerance need only be
greater than 0.01 [<i>=(10.3-10.2)/10.2</i>] for the expressions
to be regarded as equal.</p>
