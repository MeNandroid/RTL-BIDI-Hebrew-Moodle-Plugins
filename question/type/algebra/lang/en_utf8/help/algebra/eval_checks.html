<h1>Evaluation Checks</h1>

<p>When using the <i>Evaluation</i> comparison algorithm the student
response and the given question answers are both evaluated numerically 
for randomly chosen variable values. This parameter determines the
number of different set of values for the variables to use when
comparing the response to an answer.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the more variables that there are in the question
the more checks that should be performed. This parameter is not used
for questions which use the <i>SAGE</i> comparison algorithm because
it does a symbolic comparison and does not evaluate the responses
numerically.</p>
