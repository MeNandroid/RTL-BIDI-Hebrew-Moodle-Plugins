<h1>Comparison Algorithm</h1>

This selects the method by which the students' responses are compared
to all the questions answers. The different possibilities are:

<ul>
<li><b>SAGE</b><br>
This algorithm uses the Open Source <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SAGE</a>
mathematics software to perform a full symbolic algebraic comparison between
responses and answers. To use this algorithm a SAGE XML-RPC server must be
running and the Moodle server must be configured to connect to it.</li>

<li><b>Evaluation</b><br>
This is the poor man's cheat to performing algebraic comparisons! Rather than
doing a proper symbolic manipulation this method generates random numbers for
the question variables and then evaluates both the student response and the
question's answer for that set of values. This is repeated a configurable
number of times and, if tboth are equal within the selected tolerance each
time the two expressions are declared to be equal. While the <i>SAGE</i>
algorithm is certainly to be preferred this algorithm has the benefit of
not requiring any external servers or code. It is implemented entirely within
the Moodle server.</p>

<li><b>Equivalence</b><br>
This is the simplest of all the methods. It is implemented inside the algebraic
parser used by this question type. It will only perform the most basic of
comparisons between expressions. The expressions must contain the exact same
terms for a comparison to be successful. The only thing accounted for is
commutativity of the operations. Hence the terms <i>(x+1)<sup>2</sup></i> and
<i>(1+x)<sup>2</sup></i> will be found to be equal but <i>(x+1)<sup>2</sup></i>
and <i>x<sup>2</sup>+2x+1</i> will not. Like the <i>Evaluation</i> method it is
entirely implemented inside the Moodle server.</p>
