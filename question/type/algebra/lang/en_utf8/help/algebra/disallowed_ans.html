<h1>Disallowed Answer</h1>

<p><b>**NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**</b></p>

<p>This box contains an expression which will be disallowed as an answer.
Students entering an answers which matches this will be prevented from
receiving any grade for the question even if the response would match
a given answer for the question.</p>

<p>The purpose behind this is to allow for simple algebraic manipulation
questions. For example, expand the expression (x+y+z)<sup>2</sup>. If the
student simply copies the expression in the question into the answer box
then both the <i>SAGE</i> and <i>Evaluate</i> comparison algorithms would
match and the student given a correct response. With such a question the
expression (x+y+z)<sup>2</sup> should be entered into the disallowed
answer box and then a simple comparison will be performed between student
responses and the expression. Responses which match will be rejected.</p>

<p>The comparison method used will be <i>Equivalent</i> if <i>Evaluate</i>
is selected as the main algorithm and <i>Simple SAGE</i> if <i>SAGE</i>
is selected as the main comparison algorithm.</p>
