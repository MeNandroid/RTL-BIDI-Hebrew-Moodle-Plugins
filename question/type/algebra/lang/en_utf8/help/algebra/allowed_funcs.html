<h1>Allowed Functions</h1>

<p><b>**NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**</b></p>

<p>These controls can be used to restrict the functions which the students
can use in their responses. If the 'All Functions' button is checked then
there are no restrictions on functions which the students may use in
their answers. This is the default case. To restrict the allowed functions
uncheck the 'All' box and select the functions you wish to allow.</p>

<p>The purpose of this feature is to allow questions like "What is the
power series expansion of sin(x)". Clearly forbiding the students from
using trig functions in their asnwers! This is a far better way of
restricting answers that the 'disallow answer' method since it is
more general.</p>
