HiddenMod course format

To hide a Module or a Resource, indent it once (one level)
After you turn course editing Off, it will be hidden (using css styling)
BUT available for students!
so you can link a beautiful and meaningful image to it 
from anywhere in the course (ex. Labels)

Turning course editing On, will display the hidden Activity or Resource 
with a Beige background and a Dashed border.

Feedback is very much welcome (and appreciated)
