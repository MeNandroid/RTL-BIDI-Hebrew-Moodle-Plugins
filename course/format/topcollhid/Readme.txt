Introduction
------------
Topic based course format with an individual 'toggle' for each topic except 0.  This format differs from the
Accordion format in that two or more topics can be visible at the same time.

Documented on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Collapsed_Topics_course_format

Installation
------------
1. Copy 'topcollhidhid' to /course/formats/.
2. If using a Unix based system, chmod 755 on config.php - I have not tested this but have been told that it needs to be done.
3. If desired, edit the colours of the topics_collapsed.css - which contains instructions on how to have per theme colours.
4. To change the arrow graphic you need to replace arrow_up.png and arrow_down.png.  Reuse the graphics
   if you want.  Created in Paint.Net.

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------
1. Put Moodle in Maintenance Mode so that there are no users using it bar you as the adminstrator.
2. In /course/formats/ move old 'topcollhidhid' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle.
3. Follow installation instructions above.
4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.


Remembered Toggle State Instructions
------------------------------------
To have the state of the toggles be remembered beyond the session for a user (stored as a cookie in the user's
web browser local storage area), edit format.php and find the following at the towards the top...

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
    topcollhid_init('<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot ?>',
                 '<?php echo preg_replace("/[^A-Za-z0-9]/", "", $SITE->shortname) ?>',
                 '<?php echo $course->id ?>',
                 null); <!-- Expiring Cookie Initialisation - replace 'null' with your chosen duration. -->
//]]>
</script>

The word to change is 'null' which says to create a 'session cookie' for the toggle state.  There are several
predefined durations available: 'aSecond', 'aMinute', 'anHour', 'aDay', 'aWeek', 'aMonth' and 'aYear'.  For
example a remembered state of a week would be:

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
    topcollhid_init('<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot ?>',
                 '<?php echo preg_replace("/[^A-Za-z0-9]/", "", $SITE->shortname) ?>',
                 '<?php echo $course->id ?>',
                 aWeek); <!-- Expiring Cookie Initialisation - replace 'null' with your chosen duration. -->
//]]>
</script>

You can combine the durations together and perform mathematical operations, for example, to have a
duration in the future of one day 38 minutes and 30 seconds you would have:

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
    topcollhid_init('<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot ?>',
                 '<?php echo preg_replace("/[^A-Za-z0-9]/", "", $SITE->shortname) ?>',
                 '<?php echo $course->id ?>',
                 aDay + (aMinute * 38) + (aSecond * 30)); <!-- Expiring Cookie Initialisation - replace 'null' with your chosen duration. -->
//]]>
</script>

To revert back to session cookies, simply put back the word 'null'.

NOTE: The client's browser must support the persistent storage of cookies in the user's profile for this to work.  I realise that
      some configured systems do not allow this and therefore this mechanism will not work.  However, I anticipate that setting
      an expiring cookie will be fine as it will simply be deleted in environments where they are removed on log out, but will have
      use when the user is at home and remotely logs in.

Known Issues
------------

1.  AJAX Drag and Drop does not move the toggle header with the section content, so currently disabled.  Please see Moodle tracker
    CONTRIB-2975 (http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-2975).

Version Information
-------------------
21st February 2009 - Version 0.1

1st March 2009 - Version 0.2

2nd March 2009 - Version 1.0

3rd March 2009 - Version 1.1.  Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1081
  Adjusted the Topic Toggle to make the topic summary standout more.

28th June 2009 - Version 1.2 - Persistence - tested on Moodle 1.9.5.  Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1363
  1. Persistence is session based on a per user per course basis.
  2. Cookies must be enabled for it to work.
  3. I need to tidy up the code and remove the development comments.
  4. I would like to slightly alter the binary string to be an array.
  5. I would like to make the lib.js functions a part of a class for future proofing.
  6. Sort out page refresh event so that it works instead of saving the cookie every time a toggle is toggled.

15th July 2009 - Version 1.3 - Visual tidy up and Javascript file reduction! Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1471 / CONTRIB-1423
  1. Moved the prefix words of 'Topic x' to the right hand side of the toggle when the summary exists.
  2. Compressed the lib.js into lib_min.js for faster loading using YUICompressor - original source still available.
  3. Moved as much as possible into css so that the files can be cached by the web browser and less transmitted in
     terms of HTML.
  4. Sorted out the way the topic table is constructed in terms of column widths to be more robust on different
     web browsers.  Tested on a Vista PC with: FireFox 3.5, IE 8.0.6001.18783 in both normal and compatibility
     modes, Google Chrome 2.0.172.33, Safari 4.0 (530.17) and Opera 9.64 build 10487.

21st August 2009 - Version 1.3.1 - Fully comment code for future reference.  Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1486
  Additionally there are now two branches, HEAD and MOODLE_19_STABLE - this is the 1.9 branch.
  Please see the documentation on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Collapsed_Topics_course_format

24th August 2009 - Version 1.3.2 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1494
  1. Removed duplication in section name.
  2. Tidied up format.php to be XHTML strict in line with http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:JavaScript_guidelines

23rd January 2010 - Version 1.3.3 - Moodle Tracler CONTRIB-1756
  1. Put instructions in the CSS file 'topics_collapsed.css' on how you can define theme based toggle colours.
  2. Redesigned the arrow to be more 'modern'.

16th February 2010 - Version 1.3.4 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1825
  1. Removed the capability to 'Show topic x' unless editing as confusing to users.
  2. Removed redundant 'aToggle' as existing $course->numsections already contained the correct figure
     and counting toggles that are displayed causes an issue when in 'Show topic x' mode as the toggle
     number does not match the display number for the specific element.
  3. Removed redundant calls to 'get_context_instance(CONTEXT_COURSE, $course->id)' as result already
     stored in $context variable towards the top - so use in more places.

5th April 2010 - Version 1.3.5 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1952 & CONTRIB-1954
  1. CONTRIB-1952 - Having an apostrophy in the site shortname causes the format to fail.
  2. CONTRIB-1954 - Reloading of the toggles by using JavaScript DOM events not working for the function reload_toggles,
     but instead the function was being called at the end of the page regardless of the readiness state of the DOM.

9th April 2010 - Version 1.3.6 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-1973
  1. Tidied up format.php, made the fetching of topic and toggle names more efficient and sorted an incorrect comment.
  2. Tidied up this file.

11th September 2010 - Version 1.3.7 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2355
  1. Added the ability to remove 'topic x' and the section number from being displayed.  To do this, open up
     format.php in a text editor - preferably with line numbers displayed - such as Notepad++ - and read the
     instructions on lines 239 and 249.

6th November 2010 - Version 1.3.8 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2497
  1. Added Dutch language.  Thanks to Pieter Wolters - http://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=537037 - for this.
  2. Added German, French, Spanish (Spain, Mexico and International), Italian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil too)
     and Welsh.  I used Google Translate! If inaccurate, please let me know!

7th November 2010 - Version 1.3.9 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2497
  1. Added the string 'topcollhidtogglewidth' to the relevant language file and amended format.php so that
     the word 'Topic' when translated fits within the toggle.

12th November 2010 - Version 1.3.9.1 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2497
  1. Fixed issue with missing semi-colon in language file that appeared not to affect Moodle 1.9 as it
     did with the Moodle 2.0 version, but corrected anyway as a PHP syntax bug.

14th January 2011 - Version 1.4 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2660
  1. Removed redundant call to 'time()' thus was wasting processor time.

12th March 2011 - Version 1.5 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2747
  1. Make the toggle state last beyond the user session if desired.
  2. Added id of "sectionblock-0" / "sectionblock-'.$section.'" for the left side, see MDL-18232.
  3. Added class of "icon topicall" for right side expansion icons when editing, see MDL-20757.

16th March 2011 - Version 1.5.1 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2747
  1. Quick fix for Internet Explorer as it does not understand the Javascript 'const' keyword!

30th May 2011 - Version 1.5.2 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2963
  1. Added in copyright and contact information.

9th June 2011 - Version 1.5.3 - Moodle Tracker CONTRIB-2975 - Unfinished.
  1. AJAX support temporarily withdrawn due to issue with moving sections and the toggle title not following.
     Complex to resolve.

Michael de Raadt for CONTRIB-1945 & 1946 which sparked fixes in CONTRIB-1952 & CONTRIB-1954

Desired Enhancements
--------------------

1. Use ordered lists / divs instead of tables to fall in line with current web design theory.  Older versions of
   'certain' browsers causing issues in making this happen.
2. Smoother animated toggle action.
