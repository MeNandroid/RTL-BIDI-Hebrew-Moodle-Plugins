Introduction
------------

Topic based course format with an individual 'toggle' for each topic except 0.  This format differs from the
Accordion format in that two or more topics can be visible at the same time.

Installation
------------

1. Copy 'topcoll' to /course/formats/
2. If desired, edit the colours of the css files in 'topcoll'.
3. To change the arrow graphic you need to alter topcoll.php and js-override-topcoll.css.  Reuse the graphics
   if you want, it is one I made in Paint.Net.
