<p>Select the browser plug-ins you would like to be checked for in the block. Students in your course will see a tick or a cross against each one of these items indicating whether their browser seems to support the plug-in or not.
If you know you aren't using any of these files you may as well remove the tick against them.
<strong>Please Note:</strong> this block will only give you an <em>indication</em> that the plug-in is present. It won't tell you which version

<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
<p>This solution as implemented is to use the navigator.* methods supported by Mozilla, Firefox and early IE browsers to establish if support may be available. And to use the ActiveX object in later IE versions with some VBScript. Although not as reliable it gives a reasonable indication without the overhead of actually instantiating each individual object type.</p>
<p>Most comprehensive plug-in detection solutions achieve detection through attempting to instantiate an instance of the object in question by including an <object> tag in the output, then checking to see if that object exists or is able to be queried through its methods/properties. If not the detector assumes the plug-in is not available or is disabled.</p>
<p>This instantiation is effective, but also places a processing and network burden on the browser, and potentially the back-end server, which may not be appropriate on a page which is heavily or frequently visited.</p>
