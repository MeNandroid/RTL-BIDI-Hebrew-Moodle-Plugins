<p align="center"><b>Search LOs-metadata (Learning Objects)<br />
    Resources/Activities</b> </p>

<p>This block allows to search all the resources and   activities, inside a course, in the user courses, or in all the courses,   since the resources have been previously annotated with metadata LOM or   metadata DCMES. The basic search supports a number of options, listed below. It   is possible to combine them to specify your search more precisely.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>search for these words</strong></td>
    <td>For basic searching of one or more words anywhere in the texts, just type them separated by spaces. All words longer than two characters are used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>+search +for these words</strong></td>
    <td>The previous example would also match &quot;information&quot; because it contains &quot;for&quot;. To force exact matching of a word, use the plus sign.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>+search -engine</strong></td>
    <td>Use the minus sign (-) if there are particular exact words you don't want included in the search.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>&quot;search engine&quot;</strong></td>
    <td>To search for a particular phrase, use double quotes around it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>user:Vitor</strong></td>
    <td>To search for resources/activities by a particular user, prefix a word from their name with &quot;user:&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>userid:6</strong></td>
    <td>If you know the user id of a particular user, you can search for them like this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>subject:program</strong></td>
    <td>To search for a word within the subject or title of a text only, prefix the word with &quot;subject:&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For advanced searching, press the search button  ( &gt; ) without typing anything in the words field - you will see
  a complete form that makes it easier to do advanced searches.</p>
<p>In the context of the advanced research, you will see:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>Metadata:</strong></td>
    <td>You can select the type of metadata for searching  (LOM or DCMES) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong>Courses:</strong></td>
    <td>You can  specify what course(s) search inside a course, in the user courses, or in all the courses.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><strong> LOs type: </strong></td>
    <td><p>The block will be able to search only a specific  type of resources/activities, since theresource/activity  metadata refers it.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>
The resources and activities that have not been   annotated (automatically or not by the teacher) with LOM metadata or   DCMES metadata will not be available for the research of LOs (Learning Objects - resources or activities).</p>
