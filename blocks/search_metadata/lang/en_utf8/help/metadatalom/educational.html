<div class="indent">
  <p>This category describes the key educational
    or pedagogic characteristics of this learning
  object.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interactivity Type</strong>:
    Predominant mode of learning supported by
    this learning object.    &quot;<strong>Active</strong>&quot; learning (e.g., learning by doing) is
    supported by content that directly induces
    productive action by the learner. An active
    learning object prompts the learner for
    semantically meaningful input or for some
    other kind of productive action or decision,
    not necessarily performed within the learning<br />
    object's framework. Active documents
    include simulations, questionnaires, and
    exercises.    &quot;<strong>Expositive</strong>&quot; learning (e.g., passive learning)
    occurs when the learner's job mainly consists
    of absorbing the content exposed to him
    (generally through text, images or sound). An
    expositive learning object displays
    information but does not prompt the learner
    for any semantically meaningful input.<br />
    Expositive documents include essays, video
    clips, all kinds of graphical material, and
    hypertext documents.
    When a learning object blends the active and
    expositive interactivity types, then its<br />
    interactivity type is &quot;<strong>mixed</strong>&quot;.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning Resource Type:</strong> Specific kind of learning object. The most
    dominant kind shall be first. (by default, the name of LO module).</li>
    <li><strong>Interactivity Level:</strong>The degree of interactivity characterizing this
      learning object. Interactivity in this context
      refers to the degree to which the learner can
      influence the aspect or behavior of the<br />
    learning object.</li>
    <li><strong>Semantic Density:</strong>The degree of conciseness of a learning
      object. The semantic density of a learning
      object may be estimated in terms of its size,
      span, or, in the case of self-timed resources<br />
    such as audio or video, duration. </li>
    <li><strong>Intended End User Role: </strong>Principal user(s) for which this learning
    object was designed, most dominant first.</li>
    <li><strong>Context: </strong>The principal environment within which the
      learning and use of this learning object is
    intended to take place.</li>
    <li><strong>Typical Age Range:</strong> Age of the typical intended user.</li>
    <li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: How hard it is to work with or through this
      learning object for the typical intended target
    audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Typical Learning Time:</strong>Approximate or typical time it takes to work
      with or through this learning object for the
    typical intended target audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong>: Comments on how this learning object is to
    be used.</li>
    <li><strong>Language</strong>:  The human language used by the typical
    intended user of this learning object.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note:<br />
a) 0-1 (0 minimum elements - 1 maximum elements) or 1-n (1 minimum elements - n maximum elements).<br />
b) To add more than one value use &quot;;; &quot; to separate the values.<br />
c) You can choose the  option &ldquo;Insert new value&rdquo; to transform a combo box into input text box and  click button &ldquo;Refresh metadata automatically&rdquo;.<br />
d) In a combo box, choose the option &ldquo; &ldquo;(empty  or null) to not use values to the DC element.<br />
e) If you want restore the predefined values,  cleans the fields in question, save and come back to edit the register of  metadata so that the values are restore automatically.</p>
