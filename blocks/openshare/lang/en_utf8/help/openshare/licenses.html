<h1 id="osh_overview">OpenShare Licenses</h1>
<p>The <em>OpenShare</em> block in Moodle allows you to mark <em>Resources</em> or <em>Activities</em> as <strong>closed</strong> (private, for enrolled class members only) or <strong>open</strong> (available to the public. This allows you to use Moodle as a publishing platform for <a href="#ocw">opencourseware</a> or <a href="#oer">open educational resources</a>.</p>

<p>You may also add metadata to your course modules. Select Copyright, public domain, or any Creative Commons license.</p>

<h2 id="osh_cc">Creative Commons Licenses</h2>
<p>The following information is taken from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons Web site</a> under the provisions of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>.</p>


              <p>The following describes each of the six main licenses offered when you choose to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">publish your work</a> with a Creative Commons license. We have listed them starting with the most restrictive license type you can choose and ending with the most accommodating license type you can choose. It's also helpful to know there are <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/fullrights/">a set of baseline rights</a> all six licenses offer to others and we've prepared <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/think/">a list of things to think about</a> before choosing a&nbsp;license.</p>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-nc-nd">Choose by-nc-nd license</a></span>This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, allowing redistribution. This license is often called the "free advertising" license because it allows others to download your works and share them with others as long as they mention you and link back to you, but they can't change them in any way or use them commercially.<br>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-nc-sa">Choose by-nc-sa license</a></span>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. Others can download and redistribute your work just like the by-nc-nd license, but they can also translate, make remixes, and produce new stories based on your work. All new work based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also be non-commercial in nature.<br>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-nc">Choose by-nc license</a></span>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don't have to license their derivative works on the same terms.<br>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-sa">Choose by-sa license</a></span> This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial reasons, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.</p>
