<h1>Sharing Cart</h1>

<p>Sharing Cart enables sharing content (resources, activities) between multiple courses on your site.
You can share among your own courses.
It copies and moves the course items without user data -- similar to the "Import" function in Administration.
It available only for teachers, course creators and administrators.</p>

<h2>Requiements</h2>

<ol>
	<li>JavaScript: The Sharing Cart needs a browser with JavaScript enabled even if you are not using AJAX.
		AJAX turned on is recommended but not required.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Copying content to the Sharing Cart from a course:<br />
		With editing on, Sharing Cart block is shown, "Copy to Sharing Cart" icon appears after each module commands.
		Then, you can click it to make a copy of the module in Sharing Cart.</li>
	<li>Copying content to a course from the Sharing Cart:<br />
		Click "Copy to course" icon in Sharing Cart to display the target markers on each section.
		Then, select one of them to finish the copying, or "Cancel" command which is above sections.</li>
	<li>Move content into a folder:<br />
		Click "Move to folder" icon in Sharing Cart, then a drop-down list appears,
		and select the destination folder.
		If you click the "Edit" button, you will replace the drop-down list with an input box.
		You can input the name of the folder there, and press Enter to complete the operation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Known problems</h2>

<p>When the AJAX course editing is enabled, dragging Sharing Cart block to a new location in the blocks area
can cause trouble -- all the folders in the Sharing Cart freeze and you can't open or close
(this is a bug in Moodle core).
To unfreez the folders, reload the page.</p>
