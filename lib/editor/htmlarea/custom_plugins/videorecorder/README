This plugin is based on several technologies: Java, JavaScript, PHP (of course!) Flash.

This plugins is mostly based on the Video Java Recorder applet from viMas (http://www.vimas.com/video.php)
current viMas (no)license allows for 20 sec recording for a demo/no-license website use.
For commercial use and longer recording times, please contact viMas.

"The video recording applet allows to record video in mp4 format ( H.264 video and AAC audio) 
on the web page and uploads it to the web server via HTTP. Also, it allows to capture still 
images and save them on the server in JPEG format.

First, the applet records the video in the temp file on the customer's computer, 
then the user can upload the video to the web server. The server script receives 
the mp4 or JPEG file on the server and saves it into a specified folder. " 
(quoted from: http://www.vimas.com/video.php)

Users mush have a W3C standard compliant browser to use this plugin with updated Java 1.6 and Flash 10.x installed.
