AskBloom HTMLAREA custom plugin is heavily based on Ian Byrd's work: "The Differentiator"
Ian's email: ian@byrdseed.com (http://www.byrdseed.com/about/)

All right reserve to Ian Byrd

Around Aug-2010...
It was adapted to work with the Moodle framework.
Translation infrastructure was added + English and Hebrew translation.
and the necessary wrappers to make it plug into HTMLAREA editor.

Enjoy :-)
