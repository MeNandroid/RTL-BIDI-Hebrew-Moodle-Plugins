<p>Greenie is an open source theme for Moodle that was created by the guys at <a href="http://newschoollearning.com">NewSchool Learning</a> - a U.S. <a href="http://moodle.com">Moodle Partner</a>.</p>

<p>All themes are coded on top of the Standard Moodle theme so that this theme should remain stable even after Moodle upgrades.</p>

<p>If you would like a this theme modified in any way, <a href="http://newschoollearning.com/contact/">contact us</a>. We do <a href="http://newschoollearning.com/services/">custom work</a>.</p>

<h3>Thank you!</h3>
